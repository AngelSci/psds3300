    "To create the user interface as a web page, \n",

    "So far, we have seen the fluid grid system in the examples. \n",
    "Both grid systems use a flexibly sub-dividable 12-column grid for layout. The fluid system always occupies the full width of the web page and resizes its components dynamically as the size of the page changes. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is a useful behavior to adapt the layout to different types of screens like desktop, tablet, or phone with changing orientations. \n",
    "The layout is \"fluid\", it automatically adapts to the screen size and orientation. We should use this system by default. \n",
    "\n",
    "The fixed system occupies a fixed width of 940 pixels by default and may assume other widths when Bootstrap responsive layout kicks in (e.g. when on a tablet).\n",
    "\n",
    " To create a layout based on the fluid system, we use the ```fluidPage()``` function. \n",
    " To create rows within the grid, we use the ```fluidRow()``` function; \n",
    "to create columns within rows, we use the ```column()``` function. \n",
    "For example, the following piece of code would create a **sidebar column and a main column with a 2/10 ratio in width**:\n",
