    "# Lab 1 - Introduction to Advanced Visualization and Communication I\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the first module of the Advanced Visualization and Communication I course. Building on the concepts, and the tools \n",
    "and techniques we have learned in the Data Visualization course, we will go on learning the concepts of visual interactive communication and practice the tools to create dashboards for both making our visualizations interactive and also to turn our data exploration and analysis into visual tools to aim decision making. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will start with the mechanics of creating dashboards as Web apps, and we will use Shiny as a tool to turn our visualizations in R to interactive dashboards on the Web. First couple weeks will be focused on the mechanics of creating Shiny dashboards. Then, we will start looking at concepts in visual communications, human centered design, design theories and user interface designs, and finally storytelling aspects of visual communication. We will also learn how to create visual interaction tools with D3 which is another popular and versatile tool, and finally we will have a final project putting together everything we have learned to create your own visual tools/apps for presenting and exploring data visually. \n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to the Data Visualization course, we will have discussions each week regarding the concepts we learn in that week that revolves around critiquing dashboards, web apps, visualizations, and tools on the Web, and we also will discuss how to apply these concepts for our own use leading to the design and implementation of your final projects. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this first lab, we will see the mechanics of deploying Shiny apps to build interactive visualizations on the Web. We will start with the basics of a Shiny app deployment; we will see simple examples of Shiny apps and practice how to create the necessary folder and files and deploy them to our Shiny server. In later modules, we will start learning how to write apps. This first module is intended as a brief introduction to the deployment; it's OK if you do not fully understand how the interface and server are working together yet. \n",

    "## Introduction to Shiny \n",
    "\n",
    "Shiny is a *Web application framework* that allows your R code to turn into an interactive Web App. Shiny package is developed by RStudio, and is freely available for use. Your entire application can be written in R, and you do not need to know how to code in HTML or Javascript, yet you can augment your application with HTML and Javascript if you do know how. \n",
    "\n",
    "The following are some useful references for Shiny:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [shiny.rstudio.com](https://shiny.rstudio.com)\n",
    "- [Shiny function reference](http://shiny.rstudio.com/reference/shiny/latest/)\n",

    "### Shiny Server\n",
    "\n",
    "After developing your Shiny app, you need to deploy it as a Web App to run. This requires a shiny server similar to a web server. You can do it in three ways: \n",
    "\n",
    "1) You can run a local Shiny server in your own machine and use RStudio to develop and deploy your app in your machine. This will make the application available only to you. This is a good choice for development and testing phase. \n",
    "\n",
    "2) You can run a Shiny server on a machine that is connected to Internet, or on a virtual machine hosted in the cloud (such as an Amazon instance) and deploy your apps on this server in order to make them available to the rest of the Internet. \n",
    "\n",
    "3) You can use shinyapps.io web site which offers free and paid hosting for your Shiny apps (this is purely for informational purpose; we do not endorse any paid service or product).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this course, we will use our own Shiny server deployed on ** https://shiny.sgn.missouri.edu/ **. The following information in this module is based on using this Shiny server in a way that is setup to share folders between our Jupyterhub server and Shiny server. Before going into the details of deployment, let's see the basic structure of a Shiny App. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Shiny App Structure \n",
    "\n",
    "First thing to note about Shiny apps is that **they do NOT run within a Jupyter notebook**, so do not try to run the cells in this notebook that have Shiny R code in them. Most of the code given in the Jupyter notebooks are for instructional purposes; we have to create plain .R files in order to code and deploy a Shiny app (note that Jupyter notebooks have .ipynb extension). \n",
    "\n",
    "Every Shiny app consists of a ui.R file that contains the user interface code, and a server.R that contains the code that processes the data. These two files have to be saved to the **same** folder, and the folder name becomes the name of your app. Let's see a simple example: "
