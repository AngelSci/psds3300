    "The article focuses on cognitive load theory from the point of view of human learning.  \n",
    "We select this reading because, in many respects, when you are designing visualizations you are working to construct interactive environments that support learning.  \n",
    "Too much information can overload people. \n",
    "And making connections to the broader context of information that your stakeholders have access to is one mechanism for managing load.\n",
    "\n",
    "[This report](http://oceansofdata.org/sites/oceansofdata.org/files/Visualizing-Oceans-Data-Report-Dec2013.pdf) is a good example of how much thought and design goes into the visualization design regarding many aspects of human visual perception that we have seen before, and the cognitive load.
