    "### Specific Challenges for Cognitive Bias in Developing Visualizations\n",
    "\n",
    "Some examples of cognitive biases which can be interpreted in the context of visualization:\n",
    "\n",
    " - **Attraction effect** (also known as the decoy effect and the asymmetric dominance effect) is where people tend to favour the option for which there exists a similar, but slightly inferior, alternative.\n",
    "\n",
    " - **Anchoring** is where the person is uncertain as to the answer and latches on to a value or narrative which is readily available in their memory, even if this is, in hindsight, irrational.\n",
    "\n",
    " - **Adjustment** is where the person is given an initial starting point  (or result) and are reluctant to deviate too far from this value, thus inhibiting their exploration of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    " - **Confirmation bias** is where people unconsciously seek out information that confirms their current belief, ignoring information to the contrary.\n",
    "\n",
    " - **Clustering illusion** is where the user sees a pattern in the plotted data (e.g. on a scatterplot) when the data is in fact a random distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    " - **Redundancy:** Due to the fact that the visualisation can process and display a vast amount of data, the user perceives the result as being more accurate or correct than it actually is.\n",
    "\n",
    " - **Availability** is when people tend to use what is readily available (e.g what they can easily remember or what is on a display) and fails to search for further data\n",
    "\n",
    " - **Sample:** The smaller the data sample the less representative it becomes of the whole, but the display gives the impression that it is a better fit (e.g points all appear in a line)."

    "#### The Decoy Effect / Attraction Effect\n",
    "\n",
    "As one of your readings will highlight, the attraction effect ([decoy effect in our wikipedia list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decoy_effect)) is a cognitive bias that is important for visualization designers to keep in mind. The Wikipedia Definition is: \n",
    "\n",
    "> In marketing, the decoy effect (or asymmetric dominance effect) is the phenomenon whereby consumers will tend to have a specific change in preference between two options when also presented with a third option that is asymmetrically dominated. An option is asymmetrically dominated when it is inferior in all respects to one option; but, in comparison to the other option, it is inferior in some respects and superior in others. In other words, in terms of specific attributes determining preferability, it is completely dominated by (i.e., inferior to) one option and only partially dominated by the other. When the asymmetrically dominated option is present, a higher percentage of consumers will prefer the dominating option than when the asymmetrically dominated option is absent. The asymmetrically dominated option is therefore a decoy serving to increase preference for the dominating option. The decoy effect is also an example of the violation of the independence of irrelevant alternatives axiom of decision theory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why does this matter so much for the visualization work we are undertaking? First and foremost think about how frequently we begin our work with a scatterplot.  \n",
    "Considering alternatives that are potentially distracting is possibly the most significant risk for such visualizations.\n",
    "Whenever we have more than two alternatives, which is usually what we have, there is a risk, especially when we are visualizing data with multiple variables, that we will overly influence the user toward a dominant choice.\n",
    "The \"tl;dr\" (too long, didn't read) synthesis of the article focused on the attraction effect is as such:\n",
    "\n",
    ">when people visualize choice alternatives using scatterplots, the number and position of irrelevant (dominated) alternatives may influence their choice. This shift in preferences violates basic axioms of [rational choice theory](https://indigo.sgn.missouri.edu/static/PDF/AdvViz1/AsymetricAlternatives.pdf). In addition to being the first infovis study on the attraction effect, our work contributes to the ongoing debate in decision-making research on whether the effect generalizes to non-numerical formats.\n",

    " \n",
    "One other perspective to keep in mind with regards to visualization is that notion of the \"black hat\", which in security circles, are people with ill intent on the internet.  Black Hat's invade our computer systems, are reported to have hacked elections through misinformation campaigns and used information for other nefarious means.  Jeff Heer at the University of Washington and his student, Michael Correll, summarize this nicely in their paper.  Specific mechanisms for deliberately misleading people include:\n",
    "1. intentional breaks in convention\n",
    "2. data maniupulation\n",
    "3. obfuscation and \n",
    "4. nudging\n",
    "\n",
    "Their recent synopsis summarizes the \"black hat\" as follows:\n",
    "> People lie, mislead, and bullshit in a myriad of ways. Visualizations, as a form of communication, are no exception to these tendencies. Yet, the language we use to describe how people can use visualizations to mislead can be relatively sparse. For instance, one can be “lying with vis” or using “deceptive visualizations.” In this paper, we\n",
    "use the language of computer security to expand the space of ways that unscrupulous people (black hats) can manipulate visualizations for nefarious ends. In addition to forms of deception well-covered in the visualization literature, we also focus on visualizations which have fidelity to the underlying data (and so may not be considered deceptive in the ordinary use of the term in visualization), but still have negative impact on how data are perceived. We encourage\n",
    "designers to think defensively and comprehensively about how their visual designs can result in data being misinterpreted.\n"

    "### The Dual Processes of Cognition\n",

    "> The main challenges for such machine-centric processes to be effective are the difficulty to collect enough data in every local domain to know if its sample features the same statistical measures as the global sample, the difficulty to sample a variety of variables as humans would observe in a real-world environment, and the difficulty to determine what variables should be used in a decision process dynamically according to contextual conditions. With rapidly increasing capabilities of data collection, some machine-centric processes will become more effective decision tools in individual local domains at an acceptable level of biases. However, we must beware of these biases due to global statistics and missing variables in global sampling. \n",
