    "We will start with the **```hover```** action. It is very similar to the ```click``` we saw before, we need to add a few options to make it work smoothly.\n",

    "Here, \n",
    "\n",
    " - ```id``` is the name we give to the hover action \n",
    " - ```delay``` is the time in milliseconds before interface starts sending mouse location to the server. \n",
    " - ```clip``` decides if the hover area will be clipped to the plotting area. If it is false, server will receive hover events even if the mouse is outside the plotting area. \n",
    " - ```nullOutside```: if TRUE, the value will be set to ```NULL``` when the mouse exits the plotting area, otherwise the value will stop changing when the mouse exits the plotting area. \n",
    " - ```delayType``` can have two values: if ```debounce```, the hover events will stop as long as the mouse is moving; if ```throttle```, hover events will be sent every ```delay``` milliseconds. \n",
    " \n",
    "Using these options, we can modify the behavior of the ```hover``` event and come up with a smooth, natural-feeling interaction for the user. The following options are a good set to use: \n",
