    "So far, we have used **\"static\"** interfaces in our dashboards: \n",
    "the layout and the widgets were fixed; \n",
    "they were decided at the time of writing the program.\n",
    "Now, we will start looking at how to **change the user interface itself dynamically**: \n",
    "the interface will change during **runtime**. \n",
    "We will see how we can change/update the widgets based on conditions that are controlled by the user, \n",
    "or how to add and remove new UI elements programmatically while the apps are running. \n",
    "\n",
    "**A dynamic user interface enhances the user experience in two ways:**\n",
    " - First, it provides a **responsive** interface: user gets visual feedback from the interaction with the interface. \n",
    " - Second, it enables a cleaner and more efficient interface design: \n",
    "   - UI elements can be hidden until they are needed, \n",
    "   - less number of widgets can be made available at any given time, \n",
    "   - only relevant choices can be made visible depending on the current context (plot, data, etc.) \n",
    " \n",
    "The first dynamic interface example we will see is the ```conditionalPanel```.\n"

We could create any widget we want, it doesn't have to be a checkbox group. The idea is that we have a *placeholder* in the UI for the widget we want to create during runtime. \n",
    "\n",
    "**How is this different from what we have done previously?** It gives us the ability to make a **widget appear whenever we want**, and also **replace it with another widget** if we want. Using an ```if``` statement, we could choose between a checkbox group and a slider, for example.\n",

    "### ```insertUI``` and ```removeUI```\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of replacing a widget, **we can keep adding a new widget** or any UI element by using the ```insertUI``` function. \n",
    "Unlike ```renderUI```, the UI generated with ```insertUI``` is not updatable as a whole: once it’s created, it stays there. Each new call to ```insertUI``` creates more UI objects, in addition to the ones already there (all independent from one another). \n",
    "Similarly, ```removeUI``` removes an existing UI element. \n",
    "\n",
    "Below is an example to show how to do that. **Note that there is a ```tags``` element in the UI which merely serves as a place holder; we'll need that to tell the server code where to insert the new elements. **"
