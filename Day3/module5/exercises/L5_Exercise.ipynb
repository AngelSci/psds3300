Every time the user removes a word, the list should be updated with the remaining words. **Also, add an action button** to reset to the original list of words. \n",

Remember, input variables are reactive: when they change, they trigger the functions they are used in. \n",

    "**2-** You should **update** your checkbox group twice in the code: once to remove a word, and once to revert back to the original list.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3-** If you notice, there is a ```gotlines2``` that is used in the server code. **We need the original ```gotlines``` when we revert back to the original list; because every time user chooses a word to remove, those words are removed from ```gotlines2``` for good.** Question: what is the difference between ```<-``` and ```<<-``` and why do we need it here? \n",
